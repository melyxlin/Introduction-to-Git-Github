# Introduction-to-Git-Github
A tutorial/repository for my Introduction to Git/Github workshop for the Spark! Freshmen Mini-Hack and MakeBU
## So...what is Git/Github and why should we use it?
## Initializing GitHub
### Step 0: Set up Git and GitHub
*Mingle and get into groups of 2+ people. You will do the next steps in groups.*
- Download and install Git [here](https://git-scm.com/)
- Create a GitHub account
### Step 1: Create a local git repository
- When creating a new project on your local machine using git, you'll first create a new repository (a.k.a. *repo*). 
  - This will be done via terminal
1. One member of the team: open up a terminal and move to where you want to place the project on your local machine.
2. Type 'git init' to initalize a new local git repository
```shell
momol:myproject momol$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/momol/SideProjects/myproject/.git/
```
### Step 2: Adding and commiting a new file to the repo
### Step 3: Creating a new repository on GitHub
### Step 4: Push the code
## What next?
### Step 5: Clone the repo
### Step 6: Create a branch
### Step 7: Push content to the repository
### Step 8: Open a pull request
## Done!
